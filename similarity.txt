For semantic.py using en_core_web_md

'''It's interesting to note that the 
similarity scores between the words 
"cat" and "monkey", and "apple" and "banana" 
are relatively high, despite not being
 closely related semantically. 
'''


For example.py using en_core_web_sm

 '''The similarity scores may be slightly
 different when using the en_core_web_sm 
 model compared to the en_core_web_md model. 
 This is because the models are trained 
 on different data and have different 
 capacities, so they may produce slightly 
 different results.'''
